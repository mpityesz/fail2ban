# Fail2Ban filter for WordPress xmlrpc probes
#
# Blocks attempts to access xmlrpc.php, which is often targeted by bots.
# Useful if you do not use services that rely on xmlrpc.php (like the
# WordPress mobile app, Jetpack before version 4.4, some plugins, etc.).
#
# This filter checks web server access logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

[Definition]

# Regex to match log lines indicating an attempt to access xmlrpc.php.
# Fail2Ban automatically replaces <HOST> with the client IP address pattern.
# It captures both GET and POST requests targeting any URL containing "xmlrpc.php".
failregex = ^<HOST> .*"(GET|POST) .*xmlrpc\.php.*" .*$

# Regex to ignore specific patterns (optional).
# Usually, no specific ignores are needed for xmlrpc unless you have a known, legitimate use case
# that matches the failregex but should be allowed.
