# Fail2Ban filter for repeated 404 Not Found errors
#
# Blocks clients that generate numerous 404 errors, which might indicate
# vulnerability scanning or attempts to find hidden files/directories.
#
# This filter checks web server access logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
# It's recommended to use a higher maxretry value for this jail
# to avoid banning legitimate users who make occasional typos.

[Definition]

# Regex to match log lines indicating a 404 error.
# It captures common HTTP methods (GET, POST, HEAD) resulting in a 404 status code.
# Fail2Ban automatically replaces <HOST> with the client IP address pattern.
# This regex is designed to be relatively generic for common access log formats.
failregex = ^<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST|HEAD|PROPFIND|OPTIONS)\s+.* HTTP/\d\.\d" 404 .*$

# Optional: Regex to ignore certain file types that might commonly cause 404s
# but are usually harmless (e.g., missing image files, CSS maps, etc.).
# Uncomment and adjust the line below if needed. Be cautious not to ignore too much.
